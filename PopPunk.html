		 		<p>Pop-punk is a fusion music genre that combines elements of punk rock and pop music, and there's no 
		 		denying pop-punk was originally influenced by earlier styles of rock, rock punk, and hardcore genres, 
		 		which you can identify by the loud and distorted guitars. Even though some bands in the 1970's created 
		 		pop-punk music, such as the Buzzcocks and the Ramones, it wasn't until later in the 1990's that pop-punk 
		 		became commercially successful with bands such as Blink 182, Green Day, and The Offspring 
		 		bringing life to the genre. </p>
		 		<p>Pop-punk is a result of combining quick chord changes, fast-paced tempo and loud  guitars of punk rock 
		 		music with power-pop melodies and lyrical themes, although delivered with an angsty vibe. However, pop-punk, 
		 		like any genre, has evolved over the past few decades, which can be distinguished by the tonal changes mainly 
		 		in the vocals and guitars. The vocals are more clean and not as harsh in recent years compared to earlier 
		 		pop-punk when the vocals were more raw and were more in-your-face.</p>
		 		<p>Instrumentation of pop-punk music has been fairly consistent over the years, bands generally consisting 
		 		of two mild-heavily distorted electric guitars, one rhythm and one lead, bass, full drum kit and vocals, 
		 		and generally backing vocals would be performed by one of the guitarists. Some pop-punk songs may even 
		 		include an acoustic guitar or a keyboard, such as The Wonder Years and Panic! At The Disco. Despite the 
		 		loudness of a pop-punk song, generally the focus would be on the vocal performance, like any pop song the 
		 		production on the vocals must be clean, in most cases, and delivered with emotion through tone.</p>
