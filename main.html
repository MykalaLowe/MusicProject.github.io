 			<p>I am a Band Director turned Developer! I have 2 degrees in Music Education and have spent the 
 			last several years in the classroom teaching students how to play instruments and appreciate music. 
 			Throughout the pandemic, teachers were forced to move most of our lessons and classrooms to an 
 			online platform. Doing this, I discovered I really enjoyed making lessons and presentations for 
 			students and being able to use my creative skills in a different way. I started diving deeper 
 			into what tools I could use to create on the web and worked through some online lessons. 
 			I discovered that I really enjoyed coding! I then wanted to find a more formal way 
 			to continue my education and possibly change careers.</p>
 			
 			<p>I am excited for the future and hoping to find a career in the tech field that is both 
 			rewarding and can give me a chance to expand my abilities further. The professors at ARCA 
 			have been incredible. I found that being able to learn from people that have been in the 
 			field and using these skills in the real world was extra helpful for the direction I needed 
 			to take within my own abilities. I have learned and been exposed to several coding languages 
 			as well as given real life scenarios to test myself. ARCA also has been great at checking 
 			in along the way and supporting the students. I'm looking forward to what the tech field 
 			has to offer and to being a life-long learner in this new career.</p>
