		 		<p>In 1964, The Beatles made their American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. Although widely popular in the United Kingdom, 
		 		there had been a reluctance to release the Beatle's records in the US, partly because their record company wasn't sure
		 		how the American public would take to their moptop haircuts! An international news report on the Beatlemania sweeping 
		 		the UK changed all of that and just two weeks before their appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, they became overnight
		 		sensations in America, with their hit <i>I want to hold your hand</i> reaching Number 1 on the Billboard Charts. 
		 		Thousands of screaming, hysterical fans met them at the airport and within months, not only did they occupy the top five 
		 		spots on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, but everything including their hair was being copied! The Beatles became a 
		 		voice for young people, many of whom were disillusioned by the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the controversy 
		 		over the war in Vietnam. Their popularity also began a sudden rush of interest in other bands from the UK</p>
		 		<p>The Rolling Stones were known for their rebellious image, which was a hit with young people. This reputation tended to create 
		 		chaos, and their debut performance on The Ed Sullivan Show was such a debacle, that Ed Sullivan himself vowed to never 
		 		have them on the show again. Of course, they did appear 5 more times because of their popularity. The incredible success 
		 		of the Beatles and The Rolling Stones led to them both being named in the top 10 of Billboard's Top 100 artists of all time.</p>
		 		<p>Although the style of each band varied, the British Invasion bands generally played a type of rock music that was heavily 
		 		influenced by blues or a mix of rock and pop music that was dominated by the use of guitars.</p>
